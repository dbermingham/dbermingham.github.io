  <h1>Privacy Policy – Human Moments App</h1>

  <p>The Human Moments app does not collect or share any personal data. All user data, including task selections, journal entries, and preferences, are stored only on the user’s device.</p>

  <p>We do not use tracking, analytics, or advertisements of any kind. There is no account system, and no data is transmitted to external servers.</p>

  <p>The app may request permission to send local notifications. These notifications are used solely to remind users about their daily goals and habits. They do not require any personal data and are fully optional.</p>

  <p>By using the app, you agree to this local-only data usage model. This privacy policy may be updated in the future, but the app will always prioritize user privacy and data security.</p>
